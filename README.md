# angular webpack TDD

First all install all npm dependencies:
```bash
npm i
```
Then install bower dependencies:
```bash
bower i
```
then i'm using [foreman](https://github.com/strongloop/node-foreman) for multiples threads at time,
so run it by:
```bash
npm run proxy
```
Then you can watch the application working in
[http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
